Want to discuss Linux as an alternative for all your daily computing tasks? Join the Linux Instead forums&#8230;

The Forum is accessed from the link on the right of the title-bar or by [clicking here][1]!<!--more-->

One of the hardest aspects of moving to Linux from say windows is having to find and use different programs from those that you&#8217;re used to. What are the best Open Source alternatives to photoshop, office, utorrent etc etc? Hopefully the forums will be a help to solve this problem for people people moving over from other operating systems.

So whether your a Linux newbie looking for advice or a veteran willing to help others adopt Linux, get involved in the forums!

As well as the general Linux theme, there is a section for Xen based virtualization.

Cheers,  
Kev.
