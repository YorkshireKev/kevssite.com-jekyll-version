After more than 10 years away from computer game programming I figured it was time to rekindle my enthusiasm for creative coding and return to the hobby that got me interested in computers in the first place.

Back in 2000 my programming language of choice was C and C++ on Windows with DirectX and OpenGL. Today I&#8217;m looking to use JavaScript and WebGL so that anyone with a modern web browser can just click n play.<!--more-->

Back in the &#8220;old days&#8221; I used to keep an online development diary, a single html page, which I continually updated as I developed my games. Today, I&#8217;ll post blog entries instead but the concept is just the same.

So, what am I going to write? Well I thought I&#8217;d start off with a simple(ish) multiplayer shooter I&#8217;m going to call Tanx. Each player will control a tank and basically drive around a flat landscape trying to shoot other players who are also driving tanks&#8230; and tying to shoot each other&#8230; and you!

When the game is in a playable (or at least runnable) state, I&#8217;ll make it available from my resurrected game site: [manicmoo.com][1]

The idea is that the game will feature a classic gameplay feel, inspired by those 1980s 8-bit classics. So don&#8217;t expect complicated physics models and photo-realistic 3d imagery. But you can expect bright, colourful graphics and instant gameplay.
