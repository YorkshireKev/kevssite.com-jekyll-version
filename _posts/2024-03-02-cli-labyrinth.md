One of the very first games I ever played on a home computer was a maze game called Labyrinth on the ZX81. So when I wanted to learn golang and delve a little deeper into terminal development I decided to start with a simple maze game that could be run in a shell on the Linux command line.

As you can see from the screenshot, the graphics are, at best, very basic. But as a learning project, I'm quite pleased with the result.

If your interested in playing the game then you can download a pre-built versions for Linux and MacOS from [itch.io](https://yorkshirekev.itch.io/cli-labyrinth)

The source code is available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/YorkshireKev/cli-labyrinth). Please keep in mind that this was a learning excersise, so don't expect the code to meet professional standards ;-)

If you want to download the game directly onto a Linux host via curl or wget, then take a look at repleases page on the above GitHub Repo.

As I said at the top of this post, CLI-Labyrinth was inspired by the classic 16k Sinclair ZX81 game called Labyrinth, originally written in 1981. If you enjoy maze games, it's worth checking out the original - it's much better than my "modern" version.
