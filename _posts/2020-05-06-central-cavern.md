One of my all-time favourite games is Manic Miner on the ZX Spectrum. When Bug-Byte released Matthew Smith's masterpiece in 1983 the bar was raised for quality gaming on the Speccy. Sure there were many, many excellent games released on the Spectrum (I'm looking at you Ultimate) but Manic Miner is still my go-to game when I need a retro gaming fix.

Ever since I saw Mario64 in the N64 I wondered what a 3D version of Manic Miner or Jet Set Willy would look and play like. After all, if Mario could make the jump to 3D, why not Willy?

So with Covid19 removing most of my excuses for not doing a spot of coding in the evenings I thought I'd try making a 3D version of Manic Miner. Well, not the whole game, just the first level to try and get a flavour of what a 3D manic miner might look like.

Having cut my teeth with the Godot game engine on my 2D shooter Retrocadia, I'm feeling confident I can get something working... I mean, writing a 3D game... how hard could it be right?

This page is my mini-blog/development diary. I'll add sections as I make progress with the game.

# FAQ #
**Is this going to be a full 3D version of Manic Miner?**
*No, I'm only going to do the first level, Central Cavern. Hence the name of this project is called Central Cavern.
I don't think I'm up for the slog of doing more than that :/*

**When do you expect the game to be released for download?**
I'm making the game on an ad-hoc basis in my spare time so it's hard to say how long it will take me to finish, assuming I don't get stuck and/or bored and never finish it :-)
Another thing that is worrying me is the potential for being sued or something. I've read of horror stories on the internet where fans that have created games, art etc inspired by manic miner and miner Willy have received solicitors letters demanding payment over copyright of IP infringements. So although I'm not using any material or assets from the original game, I'm not confident that a game inspired by the first level of manic miner isn't infringing something.

**What software are you using to make the game?**
Well, the main game logic etc will be written using the Godot game engine, with GD Script for the programming language.
For the graphics, I'm using Blender. For sound, I'll probably use audacity to edit sound files etc, and for any 2D graphics, Gimp is my go-to choice of editor.

# 6-Jun-2020 - The First Update! #
Off to a flying start! Okay, so I've been working on for a few weeks and not posted anything yet!. Over the last few weeks, I've managed to make the basic level structure in Blender and modelled the characters for the Guardian and Miner Willy. Actually, I'd done the Guardian a year or two ago do I just dug it out, imported it into the latest version of blender and added the rigging for animation. I'll probably redo Miner Willy at some point as I'm not happy with how he's turned out.

Anyway, I've now got a very basic working program. Obviously, there is loads more work to do before it becomes anything like a working game, but I'm quite pleased with the progress so far and I've really enjoyed making it.

Here's a short video of my progress so far...
