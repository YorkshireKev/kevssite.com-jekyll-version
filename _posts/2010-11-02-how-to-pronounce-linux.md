Okay, so I often hear people (mainly at work) pronouncing Linux incorrectly, with an emphasis on the letter &#8216;I&#8217;, as you would in the word &#8216;light&#8217; for example.

Although this may *sound* more professional it really isn't. I don't know why it winds me up, but I do have to bite my tongue to stop myself from correcting people and sounding like the office nerd (which, now I think about it I probably am!).

So, to settle the matter one and for all, here is a clip of Linus Torvalds pronouncing Linux just as it should be, with a short &#8216;i&#8217;&#8230;
