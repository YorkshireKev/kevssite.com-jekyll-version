A list of machine emulators completely written in JavaScript that I find to be both impressive and interesting. Writing an emulator in any language is difficult and requires some serious programming chops. But to do it in JavaScript must surely require a level of programming genius (or maybe madness - I hear it's a fine line!) that us mere mortals can only dream of aspiring to.

These are my favourites that Iâ€™ve stumbled across, catalogued here so I can easily find them again whenever I feel the need for a retro computing fix...

These all need a modern (aka html5) browser with a fairly modern PC.

The author of the qaop/js spectrum emulator also has a [page full of emulator links](http://torinak.com/qaop/links) that is well worth checking out!
Frederic Cambus's github page also has [a nice selection of emulator links](https://github.com/fcambus/jsemu).
