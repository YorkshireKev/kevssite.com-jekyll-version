A list of machine emulators completely written in JavaScript that I find to be both impressive and interesting. Writing an emulator in any language is difficult and requires some serious programming chops. But to do it in JavaScript must surely require a level of programming genius (or maybe madness - I hear it's a fine line!) that us mere mortals can only dream of aspiring to.

These are my favourites that Iâ€™ve stumbled across, catalogued here so I can easily find them again whenever I feel the need for a retro computing fix...

These all need a modern (aka html5) browser with a fairly modern PC.
