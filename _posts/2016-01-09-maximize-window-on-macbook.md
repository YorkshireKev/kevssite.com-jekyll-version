I have recently switched to a MacBook Pro as my daily driver. One of the first things I noticed was that there was no maximise button on application windows, only a fullscreen option that hides the top status-bar. A quick google search told me that holing down ALT while clicking in the Green Icon would maximise the window instead of making it go fullscreen. Which is great! only it isn't :(
What that actually does is make the window wide enough for it's content, but that does not usually mean full screen width.

I eventually discovered that holding down SHIFT + ALT while clicking on the Green Icon does make the window fill the screen width and height.

{% highlight bash %}
ALT + SHIFT + Green Icon = Maximise (as you'd expect if on Windows/Linux).
{% endhighlight %}

Now I've got that sorted, I'm starting to wonder if the fullscreen option is a better way of working anyway...
