    My original website (The Sinclair Archives) was removed from the Internet in 2000, and I thought I&#8217;d lost the content forever. But while sorting through a load of old cd-roms destined for the bin I stumbled across a 10 year old backup disk that contained a copy of my old website.<!--more--> On the old site was a short interview I&#8217;d done with Matthew Smith, the programmer of Manic Miner and Jet Set Willy. So, here is the interview, complete with the &#8216;back story&#8217; as presented on my original site back in 1999&#8230;

    This interview came about after I had read on the comp.sys.sinclair newsgroup that Matt was back. I decided that I should drop him an email to tell him that I&#8217;d written a remake of Styx, and would remove it from my website if he wanted me to (I&#8217;m pleased to say he didn&#8217;t!).<br /> He also agreed to answer a few questions, here they are&#8230;

    Before putting the interview onto The Sinclair Archive, I thought it would be a good idea to get some proof that it was the real Matthew Smith I had been talking to. After all, I didn&#8217;t want to misrepresent Matt by putting a false interview on the net.<br /> I emailed Chris Cannon, a former Software Projects programmer, who replied <em>&#8220;It is him . . . I actually spoke to him on the phone last week, and can confirm it.&#8221;</em><br /> And Stuart Fotheringham, also a former Software Projects programmer, who replied <em>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s definately him. He emailed me with lots of things that only the real Matthew Smith could know.&#8221;</em>

    <em><strong>First, a question I&#8217;ve been wanting to ask you since 1984. What happened to &#8216;Willy meets the taxman&#8217;?</strong></em><br /> Willy meets the Taxman.<br /> Trilogy, trilogy gotta write a trilogy.<br /> Manic Miner took 8 weeks from notebook to final mastering. I came back from the holiday I took with the money from Styx and went for the burn.

  <p>
    Jet Set Willy took 8 months, although there is little extra code. most of the time went into designing and tuning the screens. I had pressure from my partners and the bugs are due to this.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Willy Meets the Taxman was to be the third in the series but I was spending more time sorting the problems other programmers were having than writing it. I was attempting to network all the software projects programmers together but my partners were just as busy trying to isolate us in individual sweatboxes.

    <em><strong>We all know that you wrote Styx, Manic Miner and Jet Set Willy, and you also did some work on The Birds and The Bee&#8217;s. Did you work on any other games?</strong></em><br /> The Birds and the Bee&#8217;s was coded by Derrick Rowson, also of Wallasey, with graphics by me. He coded JSW II which had graphics by me and Steve Wetherill (now boss of Westwood Studios)

    <em><strong>In the 80&#8242;s some magazines referred to you as the &#8216;millionaire programmer, while there were also speculation that you were ripped off. What really happened?</strong></em><br /> I never received a penny for JSW. When the money I got from Bug Byte for MM ran out, I couldn&#8217;t afford to keep my machines working. I was forced to use inferior compilers and one inadequate disk drive when I moved onto an ST. I was getting Â£50 a week (and I had to break into the office for that most weeks) and they were continually sabotaging my phone line and reputation.

    <em><strong>And finally, do you still sport the long hair and sandals?</strong></em><br /> I chopped the hair shortly before leaving SP. I do factory work when available (i.e. when I&#8217;m not on Merseyside) so I wear boots and a no.4 crop. New pics will be on my site soon. I&#8217;m worried about how little my appearance has changed ;)
