    This site originally began as a sort of world readable note pad of my Linux and IT related tinkering. I figured that some of it might be useful to other Linux enthusiasts, so I made the site public.

    I make no apologies for the obvious bias towards Linux and open source software. I believe freedom in software is a truly great thing.
