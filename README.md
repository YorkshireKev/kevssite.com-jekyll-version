This repository contains the bones of my blog, which is a static site generated by Jekyll and hosted on GitHub.

If you're looking for my published blog, rather than the sourcecode that builds my blog, you need to point your browser at [www.kevssite.com](http://www.kevssite.com)

The Jekyll theme started life on the fantastic Jekyll Now theme [Jekyll Now theme](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) by Barry Clark.
